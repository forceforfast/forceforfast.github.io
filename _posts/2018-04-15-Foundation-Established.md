The Mix Marvel Foundation (hereinafter referred to as the Mix Marvel Foundation) is a non-profit organization dedicated to the ecological development of the blockchain gaming industry and the construction, business expansion and business collaboration of the Mix Marvel platform. 

The Mix Marvel Foundation is a non-profit organization that works to support and contribute to the blockchain industry, especially the ecological development of the game ecosystem and the development and promotion of the Mix Marvel platform and related products. MixMarvel is a long-term enterprise, and to continue to advance MixMarvel's development, we need to keep absorbing the talent of the block chain industry to work with us; at the same time, to achieve some important mileage nodes in MixMarvel's development process, we also need to work with more partners and institutions. In doing so, Mix Marvel will continue to focus on social responsibility throughout. The Mix Marvel Foundation will be responsible for the day-to-day management, revenue and expenditure and security of the fund as a whole.
