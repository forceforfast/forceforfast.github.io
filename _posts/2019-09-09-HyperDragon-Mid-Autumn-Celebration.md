MixMarvel Foundation states that reported in early Sep 2019, the MixMarvel operation team will start a Airdrops & Gifts Celebration for Chinese users on Mid-Autumn Day.

In Sep 9 2019, mid-Autumn is a traditional Chinese Festival. With the full moon symbolizing family reunion, moon worship and eating moon cakes have been one of the must do things during the festival. The Mid-Autumn airdrop activity has achieved a good response in HyperDragon Community and helped HyperDragon accumulate nearly thousands DAU. 

MixMarvel foundation is glad to hand in hand with MixMarvel Team to send off gifts and moon cakes to our HyperDragon users and Chinese users. 

The MixMarvel Foundation has a quarterly back-up funding support for the community. This airdrops used 500 MIX and 2 elaborate moon cakes packagings.  MixMarvel foundation may your reunion be happy throughout the year.
