MixMarvel Foundation states that reported in November 2018, the MixMarvel operation team will start a new game project HyperSnakes, the first real-time multiplayer competitive blockchain game. 

Following the record set by HyperDragons, HyperSnakes will be the second signature product of the MixMarvel's  Hyper series games. The game targets to launch on three public chains, Ethereum, Ontology and Tron.

The game inherits the core gameplay of Snakes, and innovatively introduces many features such as Snake King mode, battle royale matches, and random weapons & power-ups spawning. With the dual-drive of quality and technology, it aims for blockchain game mass adoption and enable players to easily experience the brand-new entertainment mode of blockchain games. 

The MixMarvel Foundation very much agrees with MixMarvel's construction of its game ecosystem and the development of its game portfolio. MixMarvel emphasizes on both supporting third-party games to transform into blockchain games and developing its own games. MixMarvel dedicates its own development team on HyperSnakes. 

The MixMarvel Foundation provides financial support for this project. The funds will include but not limited to: development cost, technical hardware and software, game operation and community construction, marketing and collaboration with partners etc. The funding will cover at least the three versions of HyperSnakes, Ethereum, Tron and Onotlogy; 11,000,000 MIX Tokens in total. Additional funding might apply if needed.
