MixMarvel Foundation states that reported in July 2019, the MixMarvel operation team will reward teams or individuals who made game contents and localization support to MixMarvel games.

In July 2019, MixMarvel started a program to reward teams or individuals who helped with contents, translation and graphics adaptation of MixMarvel games. Localization is very important for MixMarvel publishing its games globally. 

All MixMarvel games are multi-lingual. Localization support teams help with texts adaption, altering the graphics and make the game natural and enjoyable for the target market. In 2019, MixMarvel mainly targeted the Korean and western markets. The localization program is long-term and will expand as MixMarvel enter more markets. 

The MixMarvel Foundation very much agrees with MixMarvel's construction of localization. Considering different culture, taste and preferences is very important for a game's success.

The MixMarvel Foundation has a 6,500,000 cumulative back-up funding support for the Localization Program. This is a long-term program and MixMarvel has dedicated monthly budget on this program.
