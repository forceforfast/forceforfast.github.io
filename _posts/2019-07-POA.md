Community members who participated in proof of actions which actions are approved by MixMarvel operation team will be rewarded. The event was successful and boosted community contribution. 

The MixMarvel Foundation very much agrees with MixMarvel's construction of POA program. Community members could share the workload that is previously taken by MixMarvel team. The actions could include but not limited to translation, localization support and community management.  

The MixMarvel Foundation has a back-up funding support for the POA Program. This is a long-term program and MixMarvel has monthly budget on this program. POA actions are awarded according to the contribution.
