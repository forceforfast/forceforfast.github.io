subtitle: MixMarvel Platform Ecosystem Construction 

---

MixMarvel Foundation states that reported in January 2018, the MixMarvel operation team will start a new game project HyperDragons, an asset-based collectible blockchain game. 

HyperDragons will be first game of the MixMarvel's  Hyper series games. The Ethereum version targets to  launch in March 2018, and MixMarvel will form collaboration with more public chains to launch the game.

As a nonfungible asset-based blockchain game, the core gameplay of HyperDragons is based on the breeding and training of the dragons. The dragons can not only be used for training and trading, but also be sent to explore or battle for massive awards. HyperDragons will be a signature product of MixMarvelâ€™s digital collectible game portfolio.  

The MixMarvel Foundation very much agrees with MixMarvel's construction of its game ecosystem and the development of its game portfolio. MixMarvel emphasizes on both supporting third-party games to transform into blockchain games and developing its own games. MixMarvel dedicates its own development team on HyperDragons. 

The MixMarvel Foundation provides financial support for this project. The funds will include but not limited to: development cost, technical hardware and software, game operation and community construction, marketing and collaboration with partners etc. XXXX MIX Tokens in total.
