MixMarvel Foundation states that reported in September 2019, the MixMarvel operation team will launch an Invitation to Receive Rewards Event to boost the community. 

On 18th September, 2019, MixMarvel started a two-week long event to promote users to invite new members to the MixMarvel community. The leading three participants who attract the most new members will receive additional rewards.

The Invitation to Receive Rewards Event was successful and reached the goal of increasing community members.  

The MixMarvel Foundation very much agrees with MixMarvel's continuous expansion of the community. 

The MixMarvel Foundation has a quarterly back-up funding support for the community. This event used 17000 MIX for bounty rewards. The leading three participants receive additional MIX rewards and each participant gets 5 MIX for getting one new member.
