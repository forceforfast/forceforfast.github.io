title: Ground Hunter Game Early-stage Investment
subtitle: MixMarvel Platform Ecosystem Construction 

---

MixMarvel Foundation states that reported in January 2018, the MixMarvel operation team will invest in a third-party game Ground Hunter.

As the early-stage investor to Ground Hunter, MixMarvel operation team believes that Ground Hunter will enhance MixMarvel game portfolio. MixMarvel will provide Ground Hunter team with technical support to help it transform into a blockchain game. If successful, this collaboration will prove that large-scale mainstream game can be transformed into a blockchain game. 

Ground Hunter is a large-scaled online first-person shooter game. MixMarvel provides blockchain technical support. All the weapons in-game will become digital assets (NFTs) on the blockchain and players' combat records will also be stored on the blockchain. 

The MixMarvel Foundation very much agrees with MixMarvel's construction of its game ecosystem and the development of its game portfolio. MixMarvel emphasizes on both supporting third-party games to transform into blockchain games and developing its own games. Ground Hunter will be a good case of third-party game.  

The MixMarvel Foundation provides financial support for this project. The funds will include but not limited to: investment cost, marketing and technical support cost; 17,500,000 MIX Tokens in total.
