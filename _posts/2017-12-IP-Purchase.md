MixMarvel Foundation states that reported in December 2017, the MixMarvel operation team will purchase the IP rights of Haunted House Diary TV series. The license will grant MixMarvel the right to produce games based on the TV series.

The TV series is a themed production based on the popular novel Haunted House Diary. The TV series has rich characters, intricate storyline and settings that fit gaming design. The TV series is going to be distributed across leading online video streaming services in China, which is likely to drive a large wave of traffic to the game. Both parties will co-market to make the game successful .

The MixMarvel Foundation very much agrees with MixMarvel's construction of its game ecosystem and the development of its game portfolio. Branded IP resources that have instant user emotional attachments and existing user base will help MixMarvel lower user acquisition cost. MixMarvel Foundation will support the operation team to continuously find quality branded IP licenses. 

The MixMarvel Foundation provides financial support for this project. The funds will include but not limited to: IP license purchase cost; XXXX MIX Tokens in total.
