title: CryptoThrone Rocket Protocol Support, Distribution and Operation
subtitle: MixMarvel Platform Ecosystem Construction 

---

MixMarvel Foundation states that reported in May 2019, the MixMarvel operation team will provide Layer-2 solution support to help CryptoThrone, an EOS based game, launch on Ontology. MixMarvel not only provides technical support but also operation and publishing services. 

CryptoThrone: Infinite World is a blockchain strategy game launched by Tonarts. It was quite successful on the EOS public chain and MixMarvel helps it launch on Ontology. Players will experience the joy of "earning by battling." 

Based on the Rocket Protocol, the core technology of Layer-2 provided by MixMarvel, the development time of the game on Ontology has been dramatically reduced. In addition, depending on the cooperation of Tonarts and MixMarvel in the token economy design, the game has set up a variety of ways to meet the needs of two types of users: "high-risk and high-return" and "low-risk and stable-return" users. 

The MixMarvel Foundation very much agrees with MixMarvel's construction of its game ecosystem and the development of its game portfolio. MixMarvel emphasizes on both supporting third-party games to transform into blockchain games and developing its own games. CryptoThrone will be a good case of third-party game.  

The MixMarvel Foundation provides financial support for this project. The funds will include but not limited to: Layer-2 technology support cost, operation and publishing costs; XXXX MIX Tokens in total.
